<p><em>What is the difference between the COR semantic repository (at cor.esipfed.org) and the BioPortal-based semantic repository (at semantic.esipfed.org)?</em></p>

<p>Both repositories are available to test semantic content and applications, 
and both are being evaluated by ESIP and the earth science community. </p>

<p>The COR is based on the relatively simple (for users) MMI Ontology Registry and Repository software. 
It provides a number of simple, basic features for working with semantic content.</p>

<p>The BioPortal-based repository has been deployed and maintained for some time by Line Pouchard at Purdue University. 
It uses the feature-rich BioPortal software developed by Stanford University's Center for Biomedical Informatics, and has a rich feature set for ontology models that emphasize OWL classes.</p>
