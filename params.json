  "body": "### Welcome to ESIP's Community Ontology Repository, or *COR*.\r\n\r\nYou've found the home page for the Community Ontology Repository for ESIP, also known as the COR. \r\n\r\nThe COR repository has been deployed with support of the ESIP Federation by members of the NSF EarthCube's X-DOMES project. The ESIP Federation wanted a simple repository that would let users try out semantic technologies, understand their benefits, and explore possible applications that used semantic resources. So they funded the deployment of the MMI project's Ontology Registry and Repository specifically for ESIP and the Earth Science community. \r\n\r\n### How do I try the COR repository? \r\n\r\nUsing COR is simple, and it's there for the earth science community to test. Go to the [COR web site](https://cor.esipfed.org/ont), register (if you don't have an account), and click the \"Add vocabulary\" button. You can probably just follow along to enter your vocabulary. If you want more help, you can see [a demonstration video](https://xdomes.tamucc.edu/video/ESIP_COR_Video_2.mp4), or [visit the help pages]().\r\n\r\n### What does it cost? What's the catch?\r\nIt doesn't cost anything to use the repository. ESIP will keep it running for the next year, at least until July 2017, while the earth science community performs tests and evaluations. You will have access to the ontologies you create, and can always use them as is or adapt them for deployment elsewhere. The only catch is that for now, ESIP can't guarantee how long this resource will persist.\r\n\r\n### Is this open source? Where did it come from?\r\nFor more information, you might want to start at these resources:\r\n* ESIP's [COR project github site](https://github.com/esipfed/cor)\r\n* EarthCube's [X-DOMES project web site](http://esipfed.org/node/9301)\r\n* MMI's [ORR project github repository](https://github.com/mmisw/)\r\n* The [ORR help pages]()\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMany thanks to the following people who helped make this resource available:\r\n* Carlos Rueda (@carueda) wrote the MMI ORR and ESIP COR software. \r\n* Erin Robinson () and the ESIP Federation funded the deployment of the Community Ontology Repository\r\n* Janet Fredericks () led the X-DOMES project, which funded recent ORR/COR development\r\n* Felimon Gayanilo () and TAMU-Corpus Christi provide operational support for MMI's ORR software and website\r\n* Tom Narock ...\r\n* Luis Bermudez ...\r\n* John Graybeal (@graybeal) provided project leadership, for a long time now. And started this web page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
