# Frequently Asked Questions

*What is the difference between the COR semantic repository (at cor.esipfed.org) and the BioPortal-based semantic repository (at semantic.esipfed.org)?*

Both repositories are available to test semantic content and applications, 
and both are being evaluated by ESIP and the earth science community. 

The COR is based on the relatively simple (for users) MMI Ontology Registry and Repository software. 
It provides a number of simple, basic features for working with semantic content.

The BioPortal-based repository has been deployed and maintained for some time by Line Pouchard's team at ... . 
It uses the feature-rich BioPortal software developed by Stanford University, and has a focus on ontologies that emphasize class models.
